# Flix-Part1

Assignment 1: Unit 1 
For this unit's app assignment, you'll build the first part of a movie browsing app--similar to Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes--that lets a user view and scroll through a list of movies. To do this, you'll learn how to get data from the internet (via an API) and display it in a scrollable list in your app; two core concepts you'll use in virtually every app you'll ever build! When finished, your app will look similar to the app pictured above.
